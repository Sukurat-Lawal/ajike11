<img src="C:\Users\USER\Downloads\laptop.jpg" alt="laptop" style="width:700px; height:400px; text-align: center">

<p style="font-size:20px;">Computer Programming is essential in our world today, running the systems<br>for almost every device we use. Computer programming language allow us<br>to tell machines what to do. Machines and human"think" very differently, so<br> promgramming languages are necessary to bridge that gap.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">he first computer programming language was created in 1883, when a<br>woman named Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his early<br>mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. <br> Because of her contribution, Lovelace is credited with creating the<br> the computer programming language. As different needhave ariden and<br>new devices have been created.</b></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">1972:<u>Pascal:</u>Devekoped by Niklaus With, Pascal was named in honor of the<br>French mathematical, physicist, and philosopher Blaise Pascal, it is easy to<br>learn and was originally created created as a tool for teaching computer<br>programming. Pascal was the main language used for software development<br>in Apple's early years</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">:<u>SQL:</u>SQL  was developed by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F.<br>Boyce at IBM. SQL stands for<br> Structured Query Language. It is used for viewing and changing information that is  SQL uses<br>command sentences called queries to add, remove, or view data.</br></p>

<img src="C:\Users\USER\Desktop\ten.jpg" alt="ten"style="width:700;height:400px"> 

<p style="font-size:20px;">1978:<u>MATLAB:</u> Developed by Cleve Moler. MATLAB stands for <b>Mat</b>rix<br> Laboratory. It is one of the best computer programming languages for<br> writing mathematical programs and is mainly used in mathematics, research,<br> and education. It can also be used to create two- and three-dimensional<br> graphics.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">1983:<u>Objective:</u>Created by Brad Cox and Tom Love, Objective-C is the main<br> computer programming language used when writing software for macOS<br> and iOS, Apple’s operating systems.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">1983:<u>C++:</u>C++is an extension of the C language and was developed by Bjarne<br> Stroustrup. It is one of the most widely used languages in the world. C++ is<br> used in game engines and high-performance software like Adobe<br> Photoshop. Most packaged software is still written in C++.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">987:<u> Perl:</u> Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a scripting<br> language designed for text editing. Its purpose was to make report processing easier. It is now widely used for many purposes, <br>including Linux system administration, Web development, and network programming.

<p style="font-size:20px;">:<u>Haskell:</u> Named after Haskell Brooks Curry, an American logician and<br> mathematician. Haskell is called a purely functional computer programming<br> language, which basically means that it is mostly mathematical. It is used by<br> many industries, especially those that deal with complicated calculations,<br> records, and number-crunching.</br><p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"1991:<u> Python:</u> Designed by Guido Van Rossum, Python is easier to read<br> and requires fewer lines of code than many other computer programming languages.<br> It was named after the British comedy group Monty Python.<br> Popular sites like Instagram use frameworks that are written in Python.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"1991:<u> Visual Basic:</u> Developed by Microsoft, Visual Basic allows programmers<br> to choose and change pre-selected chunks of code in a drag-and-drop fashion<br> through a graphical user interface (GUI).</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"1993:<u> R:</u> Developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of<br> Auckland, New Zealand, R is named after the first names of the first two<br> authors. It is mostly used by statisticians and those performing different types<br> of data analysis.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">:<u>2000:</u> C#: Developed by Microsoft with the goal of combining the computing<br> ability of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic, C# is based on C++ and is<br> similar to Java in many aspects. It is<br> used in almost all Microsoft products<br> and is primarily used for developing desktop applications.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">:<u>2003:Scala</u>: Created by Martin Odersky. Scala is a computer programming language that<br> with object-oriented programming, which is organized around data that<br> controls access to code. Its compatibility with Java makes it helpful in Android<br> development</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">:<u>2003:</u> Groovy: Developed by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter, Groovy is<br> derived from Java and improves the productivity of developers because it is<br> easy to learn and concise.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">2009:<u> Go:</u> Go was developed by Google to address problems that can occur<br> in large software systems. Since computer and technology use is much different<br> today than it was when languages such as C++, Java, and Python were<br> introduced and put to use, problems arose when huge computer systems<br> became common. Go was intended to improve the working environment for<br> programmers so they could write, read, and maintain large software systems more efficiently.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><u>2014:</u> Swift: Developed by Apple as a replacement for C, C++, and Objective-C,<br> Swift is supposed to be easier to use and allows less room for mistakes. It is<br> versatile and can be used for desktop and mobile apps and cloud services.</br></p>

<p style="font-size:50px; font-family:sans sheriff; text-align:left;">Computer Programming Languages<br> Today</br></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Most computer programming languages were inspired by or built upon<br> concepts from previous computer programming languages. Today, while<br> older languages still serve as a strong foundation for new ones, newer<br> computer programming languages make programmers’ work simpler<br>. Businesses rely heavily on programs to meet all of their data, transaction, and<br> customer service needs. Science and medicine need accurate and complex<br> programs for their research. Mobile applications must be updated to meet<br> consumer demands. And all of these new and growing needs ensure that<br> computer programming languages, both old and new, will remain<br> an important part of modern life.</br></p>
